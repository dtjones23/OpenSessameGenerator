# OpenSessameGenerator

# Description
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a feature in browser that has dynamically updated HTML and CSS through the use of JavaScript code I've created. My objective was to use JavaScript to enable a random-password-generator to work directly on the browser that will grant the user a random password when requested. When the user clicks "generate password" the page will create a window-alert that includes criteria the user will then follow in order to get their new password.
